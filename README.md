# 🏃 Marathon AI Coach MVP

This is a browser-based MVP of a personal marathon training coach. Built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) and deployable instantly with [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

## 🚀 Features
- Select from 5 marathon training plans (e.g. Higdon, Hansons, Daniels...)
- Enter your training week and session
- Upload Strava screenshots (stubbed OCR logic)
- Get personalized weekly feedback on your training progress

## 🧪 Try It Live
You can deploy this with **Streamlit Cloud**:

1. Fork this repo to your GitHub
2. Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud and log in
3. Click "New App" → select your repo and file `app.py`
4. Hit Deploy 🚀

## 🔧 Dependencies
This app only requires:
```
streamlit
pandas
```

All other logic is built-in Python. OCR logic is mocked for now.

---
📌 Future versions will support real OCR parsing, Strava API integration, and ML-based adaptive coaching.
